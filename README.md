## What is CoSA

CoSA is a set of Python and R scripts for analyzing [GISAID](http://gisaid.org/) SARS-CoV-2 sequences. 

This repository only hosts the code and the meta-analysis from GISAID data. 
To reproduce the results, you will need to be a registered GISAID user and download the fasta sequences and metadata CSV yourself.
